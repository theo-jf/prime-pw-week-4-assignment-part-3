    <ul>
      <li>I noticed during this assignment that since the values stored in the basket array are strings, functions sometimes encounter faults when a non-string is inputted (i.e. accidentally typing beats instead of "beats" into removeItem, since html thinks you're referring to an existing variable).</li>
      <li>My question: I know there are ways to force conversion of function inputs to be strings. Is this the correct approach, or would changing the way the array items are stored be a better path?</li>
      <li>(Or, at the end of the day, does this not really matter?)</li>
      <li>Another question: I added a safety check in the addItems function to make sure the first basket variable matches the item that was inputted to the function and un-shifted to the basket</li>
      <li>Is this an unnecessary addition / is there a better way to implement this?</li>
  </ul>
