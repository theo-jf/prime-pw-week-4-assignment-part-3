    <ul>
      <li>I noticed during this assignment that since the values stored in the basket array are strings, functions sometimes encounter faults when a non-string is imputed (i.e. accidentally typing beats instead of "beats").</li>
      <li>My question: I know there are ways to force conversion of function inputs to be strings. Is this the correct solution, or would changing the way the array items are stored be a better path?</li>
      <li>(Or, at the end of the day, does this not really matter?)</li>
  </ul>
